# Job-Opportunity-Resume

## Project 2 of Rutgers coding bootcamp course

## Overview
Created a webpage to show my previous work and contact information to future employers.

## Created Nav-Bar
Our first priority was to create a nav with links pertaining to sections on the page.

## Banner Section
Our banner section was next up. We included a banner image and heading named "My Coding Journey" in the center.

## Experience Section
The my work section contains 5 pictures with links to my previous work. The first picture slightly bigger then the rest. The other 4 are waiting for my future work to be linked to them.

## Footer
At the bootom of our page we included a footer containing our name, and ways to contact me.

## CSS
Our last step was to style our page. We included a simple color scheme that should stand out to employers.
